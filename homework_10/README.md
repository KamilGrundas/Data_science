## Part 1

As part of the homework assignment, you are tasked with creating a neural network using Keras mechanisms that will classify products from the fashion_mnist dataset.

Unlike the previous task, you need to create a convolutional network. Choose a network architecture and train it on the fashion_mnist dataset. Try to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy by manipulating the network parameters. Compare the accuracy of the obtained convolutional network with the accuracy of the multilayer network from the previous task. Draw conclusions.

## Part 2

In this part, we will work again with the fashion_mnist dataset.

Unlike the previous task, you need to create a convolutional network that uses VGG16 as the convolutional base.

Train the obtained network on the fashion_mnist dataset. Try to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy by manipulating the network parameters. Use fine-tuning and feature extraction techniques during training.

Compare the accuracy of the obtained convolutional network with the accuracy of the multilayer network from the previous task. Draw conclusions.
