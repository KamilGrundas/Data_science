# Homework Assignment
This homework assignment is entirely focused on linear regression and its implementation. Let's break down the homework into several parts:

1. Write a vector form of the linear regression hypothesis function.
2. Create a function that calculates the loss function in vector form.
3. Implement one step of the gradient descent.
4. Find the optimal parameters w for the dataset, allowing to predict the price of a house based on the area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms.
5. Find the same parameters using the analytical solution.
6. Compare the results.
