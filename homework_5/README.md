# Homework Assignment

In this homework assignment for this module, you will practice performing a test task for a job application. Using accelerometer data from a mobile phone, you need to classify whether a person is walking, standing, running, or climbing stairs.

Use SVM and Decision Tree algorithms from the scikit-learn library. You can use the accelerometer readings as features, but to improve the performance of the algorithms, you can first prepare the dataset and calculate time domain features. These features are described in more detail in this article.

Compare the results of both algorithms for different features and different models.
