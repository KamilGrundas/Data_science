# Homework Assignment

Tasks should be completed in a single Jupyter notebook.

## Task 1

In this task, you need to download the dataset from the provided link. You will find two files there - a 2D dataset and an MNIST dataset. Apply the K-means algorithm for clustering each of them. Use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

## Task 2

Visualize the clustering results. For the MNIST dataset, also use the PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the data to a two-dimensional version.
