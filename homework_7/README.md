# Homework Assignment

Take the MovieLens dataset and build a matrix factorization model. In this library, it is called SVD. Choose the best parameters using cross-validation and experiment with other algorithms (SVD++, NMF) to select the optimal one.

Guidelines for creating this model can be found in the library's documentation.
