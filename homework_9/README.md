# Homework Assignment

As a homework assignment, I propose creating a neural network using Keras tools that will classify products from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

You should propose your own network architecture. The accuracy of the simplest, yet adequate, neural network is around 91%. Your model's accuracy should not be lower than this value. To achieve such results, you will need to experiment with the network's hyperparameters:

- Number of layers
- Number of neurons
- Activation functions
- Number of epochs
- Batch size
- Choice of optimizer
- Various regularization techniques, etc.

Use the techniques learned for diagnosing problems during neural network training, and then perform experiments.

Please submit your solution as a separate notebook.
